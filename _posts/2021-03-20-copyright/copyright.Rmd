This page is a tutorial of r function that helps make copyrighting intellectual property on a website. 
I also walks through the file header needed to license property with *GNU General Public License*.

You need to run this function first `install.packages("lubridate")` or `install.packages("tidyverse")`.

## The R function

    copyright <- function(start, name){
      current_year <- lubridate::year(Sys.Date()) 
      if (current_year != start) {str <- glue::glue('{start} - {current_year} -- {name}')}
      else if (start < current_year) {str <- glue::glue('{current_year} -- {name}')}
      else {str <- 'Time Error'}
      pander::pander(glue::glue('<i class="far fa-copyright"></i>{str}'))
    }
    
This function is needs a start year and name pass into the function call. 

To calculate current year the [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) package is used.

## File Header
